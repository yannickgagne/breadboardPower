Breadboard Power Supply

Simple breadboard power supply with 3.3V, 5V and 12V ouput.

Can provide two different voltage at the same time to different rails.

I know it could have been way smaller with more SMD components but I wanted to use what I had on hand.

First PCB ordered from OSHPARK on 28-04-2016, will leave a not here when it tested.
